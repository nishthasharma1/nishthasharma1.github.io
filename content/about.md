### Hobbies: 

In my freetime, you could either catch me hiking in a new trail somewhere or finding new, cool spots to read books to really get my moments of peace. 

Here is my reading list that consists of books that I have read, how I liked them and ones I have been recommended and would recommend for anyone who wants to read something new:
