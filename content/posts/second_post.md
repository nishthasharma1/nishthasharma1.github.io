title: "Semester 2.5 Relfection"
---

As I was taking 4 (and a half) courses this spring and summer semester, my main goals were: 
- actively participate in my courses which entailed going to office hours for any doubts, asking questions in and after class (just opening communicating with the professors often)
- create a regimen for working out and meal prepping
- making the most of my summer and hiking
- rekindle flames such as past hobbies and people 

Trying to find my most effecient way of learning, I decided to put a spin on the way I would be studying and committing to my academic obligations as well:
- If I can't figure out the initial steps to a problem within 30 minutes, ask for help
- Create mindmaps for summaries
- Do sample exams as if they were the exams preceeding the exam day and the review the incorrect questions' solutions prior to the exam on the day (1 exam a day)

#The courses I took were:

- CHE 243 - Introduction to Thermodynamics
- Mat E 202 - Material Science
- ENG M 401 - Financial Management for Engineers
- ENGG 404 - Engineering Safety and Risk Management in Risk Management
- CIV 251 - Survey School (only spring)

Having had seminars for 3 out of 4 courses and a lab for another alongside was a common thing for me. But this time around, I thoroughly enjoyed going to my class since I had a goal in my mind - to be carefree about people’s opinions about me and be outspoken in class, even if that implied I would ask ‘dumb’ or basic questions or not give the right answer. That was what I exactly did, at least in thermodynamics. 

Thermodynamics taught me the excitement a course can engender by actively engaging in class, despite it being one of the more difficult courses in Engineering. I had so much fun talking to the professor during her office hours not only about the course but her life and academic path that not only did it result in a great connection but it also made me want to do better in her course and exams. My friends' and my constant engagement also resulted in making some great memories throughout the semester!  

Mat E was one of the worst courses in my opinion, a huge reason that could be due to my utter despise for chemistry which I have now learnt is a common feature with many other follow engineers. The course was extremely fact-dense and unlike biology, where facts are fractionally interesting, these facts were about the compositions of polymers or ceramics which unfortunately just didn’t make it for me. The redemption part of the course was the seminars and labs which it was thought-provoking questions and hands-on lab experiments. 

ENGG 404’s seminars were engaging due to the semester-long group assignment we had to finish. Fortunately, I was in a good group where most people would work and actively engage in conversations and the project. The course itself was quite plain but having guest speakers come and talk as well as the case studies made it a bit more interesting, The importance of the course was emphasized and 

ENG M 401 was fun since learning about finance was interesting to me and I know it would be beneficial in my future. There were important parts that I think have resonated with me for a while and eye-opening facts that I was shocked to hear since I wasn’t aware of them before such as the salvage values and comparisons of buying something dependent on the initial cost and the life it will be used for. This course helped me with my calculations and logical thinking since there were many numbers involved which I sometimes felt frustrated with but overall enjoyed. 

# Social Life

Living alone for the first time in the summer was an eventful experience. Having picnics outside, going and meeting with friends when there wasn’t an impending amount of school work, K-DAYS, playing basketball weres experiences I resonated with. It was meditating to go walk to a cafe and study or to discover new places. The biggest milestone was also celebrating my birthday without my family for the first time, it was when I realized the meaning of growing up in a minute scale - like how there will be moments in life where you will celebrate or remorse alone and that is the act of growing up. Regardless, my birthday was an extravagant experience that went on for several days. Eating out with friends (unfortunately I forgot to take photos :(, eating pastries from my favourtie bakery and going to the public library alone (something which I had wanted to do since first year but was to frightened to do)).
