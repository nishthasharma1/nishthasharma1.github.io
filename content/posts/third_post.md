### twenty one

happy birthday to me!

tomorrow, i would have lived for 20 whole years on planet earth and i must say, it gets triring at days. but that is when gratitudes help me strive through.
in respect to that, here are 21 things that i am utterly grateful for: 

1. my family 
    1. they are all so unique in their own ways, granted all of us have our ups and downs but it is nice to spend time with them and know that these are the people that made me who i am today by supporting me in every aspect of my life. 
    2. their health being well - it is so important to remember that as i am growing, so are they and as life goes on, mom and dadâ€™s hardships from my youth are catching up so be mindful. 
    3. their wishes - they wish well for me and i donâ€™t want to let them down. 
2. my health
    1. i have good days â†’ where i can conquer the world 
    2. i have bad days â†’ where i just want to stay in my blanket and sleep it off
    3. i have the mid days â†’ where i am not by best self, maybe a stuffed nose and a sore throat, but i am powering through with my responsibilities 
    4. but i am happy to be alive and will try to make my body be healthier so that i can have an easier days when i am old and 4'10 
3. my discipline
    1. the habit of waking up, praying/meditating sets a tone for the day 
    2. the habit of doing my bed right after i wake up or before i leave the house helps me welcome myself when i come back
    3. trying to move my body every hour helps me heel refreshed 
    4. taking my vitamins in the morning keeps me energized and sets the day on the right tone
4. my friends

    4. the ones that arenâ€™t considered as friends 
5. my job

    2. its a corporate job that financially assists me and i am not complaining in the slightest
6. my education 
    1. i am honoured to be able to study and learn about anything to everything that piques my curiosity 
    2. i am finally loving things that i had never been able to when i was in highschool like history and physics 
7. my confidence 
    1. the unwavering one â†’ the one that allows to be able to go up to people and strike up a conversation with them, despite the fact that i am an awkward person (which i am very much am sometimes and have been told on numerous occasions)

10. reading
    1. i donâ€™t read a lot, but i do like reading when i have a break, it helps me gain perspective about things that i may not have ever thought about initially 
11. writing
    1. things like this - i like writing my thoughts down and actually using prompts, it helps me understand who i am and what my opinions are 
    2. its also a great way to vent away about things, i didnâ€™t know that i actually had so many thoughts and emotions before i started writing
    3. i notekeep (a word i made all on my own), there are many things i do not know of living basically and writing them down, like new emotions that i feel or a different way i tackled some problem 
12. business casual outfits
    1. i just look so good and feel confident!!
13. my travels

    2. going to denver and making some really good friendships come out of it always helps â†’ hi hanna, anna and ryan!

19. dancing 
    1. in a club â†’ i can see why people would not enjoy that atmosphere, itâ€™s sticky, smelly and busy

20. my learning curve with cooking
    1. i have my good days, now the usual(s) are burritos with salad and patties alongside of an exquisite palate of sauces combination cured by your very own, nishtha ðŸ™‚

    3. i have a rappers era â†’ entailed of oversized clothing + talking like i am from the hood

    yeah, i am grateful for many things. 
    
    now, to things that i want to achieve in my twenty first year: 
    
    - read more â†’ this wonâ€™t be a vague goal, i want to read at at least 8 books in the next 12 months. that is achievable
    - get more habits that i am proud of â†’ i am proud of my morning habits, now, letâ€™s try night habits
        - i want to read or journal everyday, the books are right by my desk, but actually work on it
        - i want to go to the gym >3 days in a week
    - do things for myself
        - donâ€™t be ashamed to be feminine
            - paint my nails, put makeup on, wear clothes that i feel confident and comfortable in, grow plants and be the plant mom, feel free to post things without cringing
    - swear less and talk more eloquently
        - i am getting older, i donâ€™t need to swear in every sentence
    - watch less tv alone
    - spend more time outside, walk mindlessly + from work
    - cook more â†’ eating out is not good for my bank or my gut
    - take investing more seriously â†’ lets save more money and invest better
    - donâ€™t feel bad about saying no, i am allowed to have boundaries
    
    that is all i can think of as of right now, i am happy to say that i have grown up emotionally and mentally.
    
    thus, that is all for now, thank you and cheers.
    
    hope i stay safe, healthy and happy for my twenty first and make more memories. life lessons are important as well, so a couple of tears did nobody much harm :)
    
    lastly, happy birthday, nishtha
