Being a student who loves learning has many benefits that are often overlooked in the grand scheme of things of responsibilities and grades. By having the role and term affiliated with me, I can make an impact on a world that many people sought or even reminisce about in their later years, that being igniting that curious and inquisitive mindset in environments I am present in. Being carefree enough to be able to ask random people questions about their professions, or even strike a conversation about what their interests are in odd settings like the train station, or lecture hall. Or having conversations with other fellow students about a broad span of topics like how the future of the tech industry and search engines and the possibility of VR being used, or how to make the ramen seasoning from scratch. I believe that those conversations with other students and adults help spark their curiosity and leave them in a three-year-old child-like mind, who is always on the search for answers to their ‘why’s.’
