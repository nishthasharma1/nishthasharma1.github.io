Being a student who loves learning has many benefits that are often overlooked in the grand scheme of things of responsibilities and grades. By having the role and term affiliated with me, I can make an impact on a world that many people sought or even reminisced about in their later years, which is igniting that inquisitive mindset in environments I am present in. Being carefree enough to be able to ask random people questions about their professions, or even strike up a conversation about what their interests are in odd settings like the train station, or lecture hall. Or having conversations with other fellow students about a broad span of topics like the future of the tech industry and search engines the possibility of VR being used, or how to make the ramen seasoning from scratch. I believe that those conversations with other students and adults help spark their curiosity and leave them in a three-year-old child-like mind, who is always on the search for answers to their ‘whys.’
