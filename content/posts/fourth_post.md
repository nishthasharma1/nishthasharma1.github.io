WOW, what a great semester.

So, what happened (chronologically)? 

1. Met some really nice friends
2. Applied + Interviewed + Failed + Repeat
3. Finally started opening up again and becoming extroverted
4. Band Bajaa Baraat
5. Garba Night at VVC
6. Went to Denver, Colorado for an EIA conference 
7. Went to India (after 5 years)! 
8. Passed all of my classes like a big girl 
9. Drove around and had a blast! 
10. Started to cook more 

This semester was filled with new experiences that I thoroughly enjoyed. It had its ups, and its downs but overall, many lessons were learnt. 

The classes I had: 

CIV E 372 Structural Analysis

- Professor Yong Li seems to be enthusiastic about this course and would explain it well, however his notes were messy and accent was hard to understand at times, especially since he would talk really fast. Overall the course was a good course, post midterm was much more confusing the pre midterm, especially the different methods that were taught, I had to watch countless youtube videos to get a better understanding.
- Had a seminar component which was not mandatory to go to but reviewed extra questions and how to solve them from the professor so if you had trouble in a particular class; I would recommend going then.

CIV E 330 Fluid Mechanics

- Professor MacFarlane was an amateur in the teaching part since he was teaching this course for the first or second time, but his notes were different than most engineering profs which made the class more fun, it was fill in the blanks and creative. MacFarlane’s office hours were very good since he would be really patient with his concepts, I had continuously asked him for clarification on one question and he had explained it in three different ways to help me. The course itself is a very big picture course where you need to understand what is happening on the meta level, like thermodynamics which I was why I would say I enjoyed it.
- Had a seminar component led by the TAs with additional questions but was also not mandatory to go to, I would recommend due to the additional practice which was absolutely necessary for the course. I didn’t end up going to all of them but tried to solve the questions presented in the seminar myself or read the solutions to understand better.

CIV E 391 Civil Engineering Materials

- One of the most boring courses ever, hated it and barely went to class. The course content was purely memorization like MAT E 201 but with much more math (the only part that was bearable). Granted the case studies were actually interesting because I can still remember the professor talking about many historical sites and why they are diminishing and the process of them getting recovered.
- Had a mandatory lab component which was personally my favorite additional component that semester. That was the only good side to the course since the labs were hands on and taught us the practicality of what we learned. Yes, I in fact did make concrete and cement, but the interesting part was how much of its strength changes with respect to how the process even slightly changes due to various possible factors (temperature, amount of water/rocks/sand used or even the size of the rocks used)

CIV E 398 Continuum Mechanics

- Clayton Petit is the man, the myth and the legend. I loved having him as a professor again. There are some professors that people say, ‘Make or break your degree’ and I would like to say his way of teaching has definitely been a factor in that. I love how he teaches and makes his classes and assignments interactive. This was a very complicated class for its content; required lots of linear algebra once again and I am not a fan of it, which required me to struggle and ask for help many times throughout the semester and Clayton would be more than willing to help every time, no matter the weird hours I sent him the emails.
- There is a lab component which is not mandatory but it helped with the assignments (for which we had to code in Mathematica for) so much that it would be a shame if you didn’t go. Clayton would also be able to answer all the questions one could have due to the smaller quantity which I definitely took leverage of.

CIV E 395 Civil Engineering Analysis III

- I truly disliked this class only because it was an 8 am with a bad professor who I didn’t understand properly. The class content is just math and solving long word problems but with a touch of 372 and 391 here and there so it was interesting to do long math problems (really, it once took me 2 pages to solve one part of a three part question, it was brutal). There were parts where I would wonder if the derivation of how to do the math was really necessary and the notes were mediocre at its best but I got through it one way or another.
- This course had a lab component that was mandatory and had its own, additional assignment that was due at the end of the lab session. It was sometimes extremely gruesome that people would have to start the lab in the morning or the week before just so they could solve it in time.

Extracurriculars: 

- EIA → since I was a design member, there would be at least one meeting every week and sometimes an additional working session meeting (when there was a deadline, which would be around every month), there was a lot of time taken for that but I couldn’t go to all of them due time conflicts (I had labs or work at the time) or deadlines for my own assignments. However, I tried to go in as many and truly loved helping out whenever I could.
- Civil and Environmental Engineering Club → As a design member, I had to design posters and logos, I had two projects over the semester. I also tried to volunteer as much as I could!
